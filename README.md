# Predicting-Pulsar-Stars

This repository holds the Jupyter notebook developed to identify Pulsar stars from a given dataset. Along with the Jupyter notebook other python files required to implement the Neural Network model are stored.

The repository is mainly having the following files:

DeepNN.py
•	Includes all the necessary functions required to implment the Neural Network. 

•	ReLu activation function is choosen for the hidden layers whereas the Output layer computes sigmoid activation function.

•	Log Loss function is used to compute the Cost.

•	Backward propagation is implemented using Gradient Descent to facilitate the learning process.
•	The default learning rate is set to 0.0075 and the default number of iterations are 3000.
•	Predict function is also implemented to compute the accuracy of the model over training/test sets.

PulsarPrediction.ipynb
•	Implemented the Neural Network model over a Pulsar stars dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star.
•	Performed initial data exploration and data visualization by importing all the required packages.
•	Splitted the dataset into training and test sets and implemented the Neural Network model over the training set.
•	Using the parameters learned by the model over the training, predictions over the test set were computed and achieved the accuracy of 97.8%.
•	Working on improving the accuracy of the model through hyperparameter tuning and other techniques.

dnn_utils.py
•	Includes the code to compute the math behind the sigmoid and relu activation functions.

•	The dataset used to implement the Neural Network.
